Report for CS31 Project 5: Pattern Recognition

a. Brief description of notable obstacles I overcame:
	-Being able to visualize what the code I was writing was trying to accomplish (which essentially means trying to understand all of the specifics detailed in the specification) was one of the biggest obstacles I overcame. Multiple times I had to slow down and re-evaluate my code a couple times through, even re-writing a couple of the algorithms that my code was using to complete the specifications.

	-Making sure that my code was performing correctly under different edge cases and unsual input was yet another obstacle I overcame, as each of the functions had their own subtle differences in terms of what was expected for our code's actions with certain inputs. Which also leads to the next obstacle:
	
	-Figuring out how to actually throughouly test my code. Simply using "assert" statements are not enough, as this only tests the return values of the functions that you put in its parameter. Therefore, reading the values inside of the arrays after the call of the functions I coded were also required (possibly even just outputting them for manual checking as well).
	
	-Just like last project and the project before, also making sure to never go outside the bounds of an array was very important to maintain as well. Multiple times I had to make sure that I addressed the possibilities for patterns that may cause my code to look beyond the array's boundaries (i.e. a separation value of 0 or more when one of the words are found at the beginning/end of the document c-string).

	-Finding subtle syntax bugs that were silently present in my code (for example, comparing the return value of "strcmp" to 0 to see if equal and not simply leaving it alone in the conditional statement).

b. Description of the design of the program (psuedocode included):
	-for "makeProper":
		-

	-psuedocode for "makeProper":
		check for abnormal nPatterns input (i.e. negative or 0)
		repeating with each pattern
			check and remove proposed pattern with negative separation value or has words with 0 length
			iterate through word1 c-string, removing pattern if it has invalid characters and making every letter lowercase
				if item removed, continue to next iteration
			iterate through word2 c-string, removing pattern if it has invalid characters and making every letter lowercase
				if item removed, continue to next iteration
			compare seemingly-valid candidate pattern to past seen valid patterns for repeats
				if matching in any way (reversible or not), remove candidate pattern
			if candidate pattern is valid, prepare for next iteration by incrementing to next candidate pattern

	-for "rate":
		-

	-psuedocode for "rate":
		check for abnormal nPatterns input (i.e. negative or 0)
		parse document c-string into local 2D array for individual words
		iterate through inputted word1 patterns array
			compare to words in local 2D array copy
				if match, check for matching word2 within indicated separation range for that pattern
					if found, increment rating counter, and skip to iteration with next pattern


c. List of test data for inputs to thoroughly test program:
	-for "makeProper":
		-inputted number of patterns equal to 0
		-inputted number of patterns equal to negative
		-inputted array of proper patterns
		-inputted pattern with negative separation pattern
		-inputted pattern with word1 as a c-string of length 0
		-inputted pattern with word2 as a c-string of length 0
		-inputted pattern with word1 & word2 as c-strings of length 0
		-inputted pattern with word having a digit
		-inputted pattern with word having a special character
		-inputted pattern with word having a space character
		-inputted pattern with word having a zero byte in the middle of a word
		-inputted pattern with word having only one letter
		-inputted pattern with word having capital letters only
		-inputted pattern with word having mix of capital and lowercase letters
		-inputted 2 proper identical patterns
		-inputted 2 proper identical patterns but reversed word order
		-inputted 2 proper identical patterns but with differing separation values

	-for "rate":
		-document with 0 characters
		-document with 250 characters
		-document with words not separated by any spaces
		-document with words separated by multiple spaces
		-document with words separated by one space each
		-document with words separated by numbers
		-document with words separated by special characters
		-document with words that have special characters in them
		-document with words that have numbers in them
		-document that starts with spaces
		-document that ends with spaces
		-document and pattern set that has no matches
		-document and pattern set that has 1 match
		-inputted pattern set is empty
		-document with word of interest at the beginning
		-document with word of interest at the end
