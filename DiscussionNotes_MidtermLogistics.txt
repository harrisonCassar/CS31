whitespace = anyhting that appears as a blank on screen (tab, newline, space, etc.)

ostream >> () will ignore consumption of any whitespace (leaves it in input stream)


allowed a cheat-sheet;

multiple-choice:

error in code related to cin and getline (need to include cin.ignore)

code error problem (tells you what code is suposed to do, and your job is to find the error, aka debugging)

switch statement & syntax (flow control)

code-tracing problem (what is the output of code) (most are multiple-choice; give you a list of outputs)

free-response:

programming problems (free-response)
	-MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS; IF IT SAYS NUMBER INPUT, CANT ASSUME ITS INT OR DOUBLE OR LONG; 

MAKE SURE TO PRACTICE WITH COUNTING VARIABLE SUMS; OUTPUT FINAL SUM AFTER DOING ITERATIONS
STRINGS IN C++ ARE DIFFERENT THAN CSTRING
