Personal Notes

Windows:
-Scene --> what is in the game
-Game --> what player can see
-Inspector --> deeper info and such with selected object/property
-Hiearchy --> used for selecting objects and dealing with overall game properties
-Project --> shows all files (aka assets) used in a game (i.e. 3D models, audio files, scripts, and so on).

==============================================================================================================

-GameObject: everything we can see in the Scene
-components: added to GameObject to change how they look/behave
	-values can be set to change level of effect that a component has on GameObject
	-custom components can be made by writing code

		-Rigidbody: part of physics systems
			-GameObject will be subject to physics forces
		-NavMeshAgent: part of AI system
			-GameObject has ability to use AI to find its way around an environment
		-Transform: holds data on GameObject's location, rotation, and scaling
	
-Prefab: saved GameObject file with all components included
