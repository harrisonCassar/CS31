-Potential Problem on knowing how to write a program in a do-while loop style
	-DONT FORGET THE SEMICOLON
	-Guarenteed to run at least once

-might be references on mid-term, depending on whether or not he is able to go over it in class lecture

-0 % by anything WILL EQUAL 0

-Project 3: about string processing
	-str.size()
	-for (string::size_t i = 0; i < str.size(); i++)
	-#include <cctype>
		-isspace(c)
		-isalpha(c)
		-isdigit(c)
		-islower(c)
		-isupper(c)
	-#include <string>
		-have ability to work with strings
	-character addition (mapping to ASCII Values)
	-convert "123" --> 123
		-int cast(string str)
		-part of (probably) <string> library
	-NOT ALLOWED TO USE atoi('2')

-functions' arguments:
	-pass by value
		-int hello(int number); --> hello(var1)
		-essentially passing in just a value copy
	-pass by reference
		-int hello(int& number); --> hello (var1); var1 will = whatever changed inside of function)
		-essentially passing in the actual variable

-MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE #include <string>

-assignment operation returns value of assignment

-unsigned type --> type that can't store a negative value
	-unsigned int <====> unsigned
	-purpose:
		-compiler will catch any mistakes in assigning it a negative value
		-can store 2x as many values
	-only can have unsigned integer type (and characters too)
	-having a captial 'U' after an intger means that it is unsigned

-auto type --> automatically

-PALINDRONE PROBLEMS ARE COMMON ON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS :OO
